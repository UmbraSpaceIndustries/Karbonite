------------------
Corrected node on 0.625m Karbonite engine
Various bulkhead profile updates
deprecated KASModuleGrab
Removed content notes from tank descriptions as these are now shown properly in stock
Fixed quantities for the karry kans
The OC-34N can now extract water!
Updated FireSpitter, USITools, and CRP versions
Some minor name changes for consistency and sorting

BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS - KARBONITE ROCKET ENGINES:
Karbonite rocket engines have the benefit of significantly higher thrust than other engines in their size class (generally one tier higher).  They have the disadvantage of reduced ISP and increased heat generation.  

Additionally, all KREs now feature the Monoprop collector that until now was exclusively a feature of the 0.625m engine.



BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS - SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS:
Karbonite SRBs have the benefit of significantly higher thrust than their solidfuel counterparts, and may also be refilled.  They have the disadvantage of being slightly unstable (this has been significantly reduced in this update), increased heat generation, and low ISP.

BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS - ATMOSPHERIC ENGINES:
Karbonite Prop/Jet Engines have the benefits of slightly better thrust and the ability to operate in non-oxygen atmospheres.  Their downsides are decreased efficiency due to fuel mass, reduced ISP, and higher heat generation.
 
The included LF Jet Engines are now slightly beefier (and heavier) than the stock TRE, but with an atmospheric curve similar to the BJE.
The LF propfan has thrust between the BJE and TRE, but excellent fuel efficiency at the cost of being a subsonic engine, so ideal for low-speed long-range cruising.

Karbonite Jet/Prop engines have a 20% thrust increase, and 100% heat generation increase when compared to their LF counterparts.
